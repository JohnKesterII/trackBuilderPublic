# Track Builder (Public Testing)

This repository contains experimental code for a custom track builder.  
Please note that everything here is still in **testing** and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or code that isn’t optimized. Functionality can break, and code quality may vary.  

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome — but expect things to be unstable while development continues.
